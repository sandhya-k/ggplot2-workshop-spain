# GGPlot Workshop Spain

Description:

Graphing data is one of the core components of data analysis. Visualizing information can help journalists quickly identify trends within a dataset, and a powerful visual can tell a compelling story. In this workshop, I'll present the basics of the ggplot2 package in R (an open-source statistical language), including installing the package and using it for plotting, exploring, and transforming data. Attendees will leave with an appreciation for the grammar of graphics and the power of ggplot2 for both exploratory and explanatory purposes.

The talk will be done in Spanish and English (and the slides are mixed as well)
